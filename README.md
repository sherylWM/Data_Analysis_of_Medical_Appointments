# Project 2 - Data Analysis of Medical Appointments
This is the second project of the Udacity Data Analytics Nano degree.

Goal: To perform exploratory data analysis of No-show appointments using Python's pandas and Numpy packages in Jupyter Notebook. 

Details:
Dataset: noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv contains all information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

Following research questions were selected for this project.
1. What factors are important for us to know if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2. Do patients show up more if appointments are scheduled on weekends or weekdays?
3. Does waiting time i.e. ScheduledDay - AppointmentDay lead to no shows?
